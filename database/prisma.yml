#endpoint: ''

hooks:
  post-deploy:
    - graphql get-schema --project database

# Here's a quick explanation of each property you see in that file:

# - `endpoint`: The HTTP endpoint for your Prisma API. It is actually required to deploy your Prisma API. It will be gerated when we deploy.
# - `datamodel`: This simply points to the _data model_ which is the foundation for the Prisma CRUD API.
# - `secret`: You want to protect your Prisma service and require requests against your Prisma API to be authenticated. This _secret is used to sign JWTs_ which need to be included in the `Authorization` header of any HTTP requests made against the API.
